<h3>Here's a time line of Aaron Swartz's life:</h3>
<ul>
  <li><strong>1986</strong> - born in Highland Park, Illinois</li>
  <li><strong>1999</strong> - won an ArsDigita Prize, given to young people who create "useful, educational, and collaborative" noncommercial websites</li>
  <li><strong>2000</strong> - became a member of the working group that authored the RSS 1.0 web syndication specification</li>
  <li><strong>2004</strong> - enrolled in Stanford University, dropped out the next year</li>
  <li><strong>2005</strong> - started his first startup Infogami, designed as a flexible content management system to allow the creation of rich and visually interesting websites or a form of wiki for structured data</li> 
  <li><strong>2007</strong> - started Jottit, another attempt to create another markdown driven content management system in Python</li>
  <li><strong>2008</strong> - founded Watchdog.net, "the good government site with teeth," to aggregate and visualize data about politicians. In the same year, he wrote a widely circulated Guerilla Open Access Manifesto. One of his more notorious works that supports activism is Deaddrop, now renamed to SecureDrop, a platform for secure communication between journalists and sources (whistleblowers) used at several news organizations, including ProPublica, The Intercept, The Guardian, and The Washington Post</li>
  <li><strong>2009</strong> - helped launch the Progressive Change Campaign Committee, and wrote on his blog, "I spend my days experimenting with new ways to get progressive policies enacted and progressive politicians elected." Swartz led the first activism event of his career with the Progressive Change Campaign Committee, delivering thousands of "Honor Kennedy" petition signatures to Massachusetts legislators asking them to fulfill former Senator Ted Kennedy's last wish by appointing a senator to vote for health care reform</li>
  <li><strong>2010</strong> - co-founded Demand Progress, a political advocacy group that organizes people online to "take action by contacting Congress and other leaders, funding pressure tactics, and spreading the word" about civil liberties, government reform, and other issues</li>
  <li><strong>2010</strong> - filed a Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) request to learn about the treatment of Chelsea Manning, alleged source for WikiLeaks</li>
  <li><strong>2011</strong> - was arrested near the Harvard campus by MIT police and a U.S. Secret Service agent. He was arraigned in Cambridge District Court on two state charges of breaking and entering with intent to commit a felony</li>
  <li><strong>2013</strong> - committed suicide, died at age of 27</li>
</ul>
<p class="remarks1"><strong>"He used his prodigious skills as a programmer and technologist not to enrich himself but to make the Internet and the world a fairer, better place."</strong></p>
